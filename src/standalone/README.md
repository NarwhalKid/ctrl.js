# ctrl.js Standalone

These are the app files for a standalone DeskGap app.

The "Build" process is unorthodox, but it works.   Simply replace the files within a previously-released ctrl.js Standalone app with the files here.

This is because the node_modules folder in the DeskGap app is devilishly sensitive.

One wrong audit or update and the DeskGap exe will simply refuse to open, or tell you robotjs is not a valid Win32 application.
